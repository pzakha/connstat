# This file describes connstat unit test cases. Each test must define the
# following mapping keys:
#
# name: The name of the test case
# assertion: A verbose description of what the test asserts
# arguments: Command-line arguments to pass to connstat. The test case can
#   test the assertion with multiple sets of command-line arguments by
#   providing a list, in which case the test will be run for each element
#   in the list.
# exit: The expected connstat exit code. Note that if the expected exit code
#   is non-zero, any non-zero exit status will be considered a passing test.
#   The test considers any non-zero exit status as equivalent.
#
# Each test may be accompanied by the following files in the tests_io
# subdirectory:
#
# <name>.in: Synthetic /proc/net/stats_tcp text that will be read by connstat.
#   If this file doesn't exist, the test framework will default to using the
#   file named default.in for input.
# <name>.out: Expected connstat output (only needed for tests that ar
#   expected to exit success (with status 0). The test will fail if the
#   connstat output doesn't match the contents of this file.

    If connstat supports a field that the underlying stats file doesn't output
